# 📊 Expense Averaging System Guide

## 🎯 **Purpose**
Transform large, irregular payments (like yearly health insurance) into smooth monthly budgeting amounts for better financial planning.

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### Example: Health Insurance
- **Actual Payment**: ¥120,000 paid once in July
- **Averaged View**: ¥10,000 shown every month (120,000 ÷ 12 months)

### Supported Frequencies
- **Monthly**: No averaging needed (already monthly)
- **Quarterly**: Divided by 3 months (¥30,000 quarterly = ¥10,000/month)
- **Yearly**: Divided by 12 months (¥120,000 yearly = ¥10,000/month)

## 📱 **How to Use**

### 1. Set Up Recurring Expense with Averaging
1. Go to **🔄 Recurring Expenses** tab
2. Click **➕ Add New**
3. Fill in details (name, merchant, amount, etc.)
4. Choose **Quarterly** or **Yearly** frequency
5. Set **Averaging Type** to **"Average across months"**
6. Save the recurring expense

### 2. Dashboard View Modes
Once you have averaging expenses set up:

#### 📅 **Actual Payments** View
- Shows real spikes when payments occurred
- July: ¥120,000 health insurance spike
- Other months: ¥0 for health insurance

#### 📊 **Averaged Budgeting** View
- Shows smooth monthly amounts
- Every month: ¥10,000 for health insurance
- Perfect for monthly budgeting and planning

### 3. Switch Between Views
- Toggle appears on Dashboard when you have averaging expenses
- Click between **📅 Actual Payments** and **📊 Averaged Budgeting**
- All charts and KPIs update automatically
